# Lost-Grid-Autocompletion-ST
Sublime text snippets for CSS and SCSS for Lost Grid autocompletion
https://github.com/corysimmons/lost

Find your Sublime packages folder by going to Preferences>Browse Packages (on Mac. Not sure about Windows.)
Create a folder and paste all the snippet files in it. I have mine within the User folder, but I don't think the location within packages will prevent it from working. You shouldn't have to restart Sublime Text, but if it doesn't work after copying the files, restarting should make them work.

The autocompletions are as follows. Most of them should show up when you type the first few letters. Refer to the Lost repo for details on what Lost does.
